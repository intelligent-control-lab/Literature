  abstract={Human workers and robots are two major workforces in modern factories. For safety reasons, they are separated, which limits the productive potentials of both parties. It is promising if we can combine human’s flexibility and robot’s productivity in manufacturing. This paper investigates the modeling and controller design method of workspace sharing human-robot assembly teams and adopts a two-layer interaction model between the human and the robot. In theoretical analysis, enforcing invariance in a safe set guarantees safety. In imple- mentation, an integrated method concerning online learning of closed loop human behavior and receding horizon control in the safe set is proposed. Simulation results in a 2D setup confirm the safety and efficiency of the algorithm.}

This paper proposes a safe set method for designing the robot controller and offers theoretical guarantees of safety. The interactions are modeled in a multi-agent system framework. To deal with humans in the loop, we design a parameter adaptation algorithm (PAA) to learn the closed loop behavior of humans online. Then a safe set (a subset of the state space) is constructed and the optimal control law is mapped to the set of control which can make the safe set invariant. This algorithm is applied with different safety constraints to both mobile robots and robot arms. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

However, during HRI, the uncertainty levels are changing in different phases of the interaction, which is not captured by SSA. A safe exploration algorithm (SEA) is proposed in this paper to address the uncertainty levels in the robot control. To estimate the uncertainty levels online, a learning method in the belief space is developed. A comparative study between SSA and SEA is conducted.

The robot motion planning and control problem in a human involved environment is posed as a constrained optimal control problem. A modularized parallel controller structure is proposed to solve the problem online, which includes a baseline controller that ensures efficiency, and a safety controller that addresses real time safety by making a safe set invariant.

  abstract={The rise of robot-robot interactions (RRI) is pushing for novel controller design techniques. Instead of using fixed control laws, robots should choose actions to minimize some cost functions specified by the designer. However, since the cost function of one robot may not be known to other robots (information asymmetry), special reasoning strategies are needed for multiple robots to learn to cooperate. Analysis shows that conventional learning and control strategies can lead to instability in a multi-agent system since the imperfection of other agents is not considered. In this paper, a new learning and control strategy that deals with interactions among imperfect agents is proposed. Analysis and simulation results show that the proposed strategy improves the performance of the system.}

Human safety is one of the biggest concerns in HRI. As humans will respond to the robot's movement, interactions need to be considered explicitly by the robot. A systematic approach to design the robot behavior towards safe HRI is discussed in this chapter. By modeling the interactions in a multi-agent framework, the safety issues are understood as conflicts in the multi-agent system. By mimicking human's social behavior, the robot's behavior is constrained by the "no-collision" social norm and the uncertainties it perceives for human motions. An efficient action is then found within the constraints. Both analysis and human-involved simulation verify the effectiveness of the method.}

  abstract={Recent works of non-rigid registration have shown promising applications on tasks of deformable manipulation. Those approaches use thin plate spline-robust point matching (TPS-RPM) algorithm to regress a transformation function, which could generate a corresponding manipulation trajectory given a new pose/shape of the object. However, this method regards the object as a bunch of discrete and independent points. Structural information, such as shape and length, is lost during the transformation. This limitation makes the object’s final shape to differ from training to test, and can sometimes cause damage to the object because of excessive stretching. To deal with these problems, this paper introduces a tangent space mapping (TSM) algorithm, which maps the deformable object in the tangent space instead of the Cartesian space to maintain structural information. The new algorithm is shown to be robust to the changes in the object’s pose/shape, and the object’s final shape is similar to that of training. It is also guaranteed not to overstretch the object during manipulation. A series of rope manipulation tests are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

  abstract={From the driving strategy point of view, a major challenge for autonomous vehicles in urban environment is to behave defensively to potential dangers, yet to not overreact to threats with low probability. As it is overwhelming to program the action rules case-by-case, a unified planning framework under uncertainty is proposed in this paper, which achieves a non-conservatively defensive strategy (NCDS) in various kinds of scenarios for urban autonomous driving. First, uncertainties in urban scenarios are simplified to two probabilistic cases, namely passing and yielding. Two-way-stop intersection is used as an exemplar scenario to illustrate the derivation of probabilities for different intentions of others via a logistic regression model. Then a deterministic planner is designed as the baseline. Also, a safe set is defined, which considers both current and preview safety. The planning framework under uncertainty is then proposed, in which safety is guaranteed and overcautious behavior is prevented. Finally, the proposed planning framework is tested by simulation in the exemplar scenario, which demonstrates that an NCDS can be realistically achieved by employing the proposed framework.}

  abstract={The development of automated vehicles brings new challenges to road safety. The behavior of the automated vehicles should be carefully designed in order to interact with the environment and other vehicles efficiently and safely. The robustly-safe automated driving system (ROAD) prevents or minimizes occurrences of collisions of the automated vehicles with surrounding vehicles and moving objects while maintaining efficiency. A set of design principles are elaborated based on the previous work, including robust perception and cognition algorithms for environment monitoring and high level decision making and low level control algorithms for safe maneuvering of the automated vehicle. The autonomous driving problem in mixed traffic is posed as a stochastic optimization problem, which is solved by 1) behavior classification and trajectory prediction of the surrounding vehicles, and 2) an unique parallel planner architecture which addresses the efficiency goal and the safety goal separately. Extensive simulations are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which evaluate both high level decision making and low level vehicle regulation. Two typical scenarios are considered, driving on freeway and driving in unstructured environments such as parking lots. In the simulation, multiple moving agents representing surrounding vehicles and pedestrians are added to the environment, some of which are controlled by human users in order to test the real time response of the automated vehicle.}

This paper discusses a fast online optimization algorithm for trajectory smoothing, which transforms the original non-convex problem to a convex problem so that it can be solved efficiently online. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated in various cases, and is compared to that of conventional sequential quadratic programming (SQP). It is shown that the computation time is greatly reduced using the proposed algorithm.}

  abstract={Conventional layered planning architecture temporally partitions the spatiotemporal motion planning by the path and speed, which is not suitable for lane change and overtaking scenarios with moving obstacles. In this paper, we propose to spatially partition the motion planning by longitudinal and lateral motions along the rough reference path in the Frenét Frame, which makes it possible to create linearized safety constraints for each layer in a variety of on-road driving scenarios. A generic environmental representation methodology is proposed with three topological elements and corresponding longitudinal constraints to compose all driving scenarios mentioned in this paper according to the overlap between the potential path of the autonomous vehicle and predicted path of other road users. Planners combining A* search and quadratic programming (QP) are designed to plan both rough long-term longitudinal motions and short-term trajectories to exploit the advantages of both search-based and optimization-based methods. Limits of vehicle kinematics and dynamics are considered in the planners to handle extreme cases. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can plan collision-free motions with high driving quality under complicated scenarios and emergency situations.}

  abstract={Automatic valet parking is widely viewed as a milestone towards fully autonomous driving. One of the key problems is nonholonomic path planning in maze-like environments (e.g. parking lots). To balance efficiency and passenger comfort, the planner needs to minimize the length of the path as well as the number of gear shifts. Lattice A* search is widely adopted for optimal path planning. However, existing heuristics do not evaluate the nonholonomic dynamic constraint and the collision avoidance constraint simultaneously, which may mislead the search. To efficiently search the environment, the boundary layer heuristic is proposed which puts large cost in the area that the vehicle must shift gear to escape. Such area is called the boundary layer. A simple and efficient geometric method to compute the boundary layer is proposed. The admissibility and consistency of the additive combination of the boundary layer heuristic and existing heuristics are proved in the paper. The simulation results verify that the introduction of the boundary layer heuristic improves the search performance by reducing the computation time by 56.1%.}

Due to nonlinear system dynamics and obstacles in the environment, the trajectory optimization problems are highly nonlinear and non convex, hence hard to be computed online. Liu, Lin and Tomizuka proposed the convex feasible set algorithm (CFS) to handle the non convex optimization in real time by convexification. However, one limitation of CFS is that it will not converge to local optima when there are nonlinear equality constraints. In this paper, the slack convex feasible set algorithm (SCFS) is proposed to handle the nonlinear equality constraints, e.g. nonlinear system dynamics, by introducing slack variables to relax the constraints. The geometric interpretation of the method is discussed. The feasibility and convergence of the SCFS algorithm is proved. It is demonstrated that SCFS performs better than existing non convex optimization methods such as interior-point, active set and sequential quadratic programming, as it requires less computation time and converges faster.}

  abstract={Motion planning is one of the core modules for autonomous driving. Among the current motion planning techniques, optimization-based methods have unique advantages since they allow planning in continuous space and they can evaluate multiple objectives (such as hard constraints) in one formulation. However, it is hard to implement optimization-based methods in real-time in complicated environments due to 1) high computational complexity as the optimization problems are usually non-convex; and 2) difficulty to guarantee closed-loop performance because the low level trajectory tracking controller cannot perform perfect tracking. To solve the first challenge, convex feasible set algorithm (CFS) has been proposed for real time non-convex optimization. To solve the second challenge, a fast optimization-based autonomous driving motion planner (FOAD) is proposed in this paper which implements a soft constrained convex feasible set algorithm (SCCFS) as an enhanced version of CFS. The concept of closed-loop smoothness is defined and analyzed in this paper. Simulations and real vehicle experiments verify the efficiency and capability of the planner.}

  abstract={This paper proposes a novel communication-enabled distributed conflict resolution mechanism for interactions among connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The environments under consideration are generalized intersections where multiple incoming and outgoing lanes intersect. All vehicles close to the intersection are requested to broadcast their estimated times to occupy the conflict zones where a conflict zone is identified when the extensions of two incoming lanes intersect. The conflict resolution strategy is decoupled temporally for a vehicle. In a decision maker, the vehicle computes the desired time slot to pass the conflict zones based on the broadcasted information by solving a conflict graph locally. Then in a motion planner, the vehicle computes the desired speed profile by solving a temporal optimization problem constrained in the desired time slot. The estimated time to occupy the conflict zones given the new speed profile is then broadcasted again. It is shown theoretically that the aggregation of these local decisions solves the conflicts globally. Moreover, this mechanism increases the efficiency of autonomous vehicles, and outperforms conventional mechanisms such as traffic light or stop sign in a four-way intersection in terms of delay time and throughput as demonstrated by simulation.}

In this paper, we introduce an analytical traffic model for unmanaged intersections accounting for microscopic vehicle interactions. The macroscopic property, i.e., delay at the intersection, is modeled as an event-driven stochastic dynamic process, whose dynamics encode the microscopic vehicle behaviors. The distribution of macroscopic properties can be obtained through either direct analysis or event-driven simulation. They are more efficient than conventional (time-driven) traffic simulation, and capture more microscopic details compared to conventional macroscopic flow models. We illustrate the efficiency of this method by delay analyses under two different policies at a two-lane intersection. The proposed model allows for 1) efficient and effective comparison among different policies, 2) policy optimization, 3) traffic prediction, and 4) system optimization (e.g., infrastructure and protocol).}

To ensure that co-robots operate efficiently and safely in dynamic uncertain environments, this paper introduces the robot safe interaction system. In order to address the uncertainties during human-robot interactions, a unique parallel planning and control architecture is proposed, which has a long term global planner to ensure efficiency of robot behavior, and a short term local planner to ensure real time safety under uncertainties. In order for the robot to respond immediately to environmental changes, fast algorithms are used for real-time computation, i.e., the convex feasible set algorithm for the long term optimization, and the safe set algorithm for the short term optimization. Several test platforms are introduced for safe evaluation of the developed system in the early phase of deployment. The effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed method have been verified in experiment with an industrial robot manipulator.}

Those robots operate in dynamic uncertain environment with limited computation capacity. The design objective is to maximize their task efficiency while guaranteeing safety. This paper discusses a set of design principles of the safe and efficient robot collaboration system (SERoCS) for the next generation co-robots, which consists of robust cognition algorithms for environment monitoring, optimal task planning algorithms for safe human-robot collaborations, and safe motion planning and control algorithms for safe human-robot interactions.

  abstract={Recent developments in multi-agent imitation learning have shown promising results for modeling the behavior of human drivers. However, it is challenging to capture emergent traffic behaviors that are observed in real-world datasets. Such behaviors arise due to the many local interactions between agents that are not commonly accounted for in imitation learning. This paper proposes Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (RAIL), which integrates reward augmentation into the multi-agent imitation learning framework and allows the designer to specify prior knowledge in a principled fashion. We prove that convergence guarantees for the imitation learning process are preserved under the application of reward augmentation. This method is validated in a driving scenario, where an entire traffic scene is controlled by driving policies learned using our proposed algorithm. Further, we demonstrate improved performance in comparison to traditional imitation learning algorithms both in terms of the local actions of a single agent and the behavior of emergent properties in complex, multi-agent settings.}

  abstract={Human motion prediction is an important component to facilitate human robot interaction. Robots need to accurately predict human's future movement in order to efficiently collaborate with humans, as well as to safely plan its own motion trajectories. Many recent approaches predict human's future movement using deep learning methods, such as recurrent neural networks. However, existing methods lack the ability to adapt to time-varying human behaviors. Moreover, many of them do not quantify uncertainties in the prediction. This paper proposes a new approach that uses an adaptable neural network for human motion prediction, in order to accommodate human's time-varying behaviors and to provide uncertainty bounds of the predictions in real time. In particular, a neural network is trained offline to represent the human motion transition model. Recursive least square parameter adaptation algorithm (RLS-PAA) is adopted for online parameter adaptation of the neural network and for uncertainty estimation. Experiments on several human motion datasets verify that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach with a significant improvement in terms of prediction accuracy and computation efficiency.}

  abstract={In highly interactive driving scenarios, accurate prediction of other road participants is critical for safe and efficient navigation of autonomous cars. Prediction is challenging due to the difficulty in modeling various driving behavior, or learning such a model. The model should be interactive and reflect individual differences. Imitation learning methods, such as parameter sharing generative adversarial imitation learning (PS-GAIL), are able to learn interactive models. However, the learned models average out individual differences. When used to predict trajectories of individual vehicles, these models are biased. This paper introduces an adaptable generative prediction framework (AGen), which performs online adaptation of the offline learned models to recover individual differences for better prediction. In particular, we combine the recursive least square parameter adaptation algorithm (RLS-PAA) with the offline learned model from PS-GAIL. RLS-PAA has analytical solutions and is able to adapt the model for every single vehicle efficiently online. The proposed method is able to reduce the root mean squared prediction error in a 2.5s time window by 60%, compared with PS-GAIL.}

  abstract={Neural network autonomous driving policies are widely explored. However, no matter using imitation learning or reinforcement learning, the network policies are generally hard to train, and the learned knowledge encoded in neural network policies are hard to transfer. We propose to modularize the complicated driving policies in terms of the driving attributes, and present the parallel attribute networks (PAN), which can learn to fullfill the requirements of the attributes in the driving tasks separately, and later assemble their knowledge together. Concretely, we first train a policy network that accomplish the base lane tracking attribute. The modules for the add-on attributes such as avoiding obstacles and obeying traffic rules are then trained to map the corresponding state to a satisfactory set of the vehicle action space. Finally the reference action given by the base policy is projected into the satisfactory sets so as to satisfy the requirements of all the attributes. Using the PAN, many complicated tasks that are hard to train from scratch can be easily trained; also unseen driving tasks can be solved in a zero-shot manner by assembling the pretrained attribute modules. We have validated the capability of our model on a class of autonomous driving problems with attributes of obstacle avoidance, traffic light and speed limit in simulation. Experimental results based on an obstacle avoidance task are also presented.}

  abstract={Safe autonomy is important in many application domains, especially for applications involving interactions with humans. Existing safe control algorithms are similar to each other in the sense that: they all provide control input to maintain a low value of an energy function that measures safety. In different methods, the energy function is called a potential function, a safety index, or a barrier function. The connections and relative advantages among these methods remain unclear. This paper introduces a unified framework to derive safe control laws using energy functions. We demonstrate how to integrate existing controllers based on potential field method, safe set algorithm, barrier function method, and sliding mode algorithm into this unified framework. In addition to theoretical comparison, this paper also introduces a benchmark which implements and compares existing methods on a variety of problems with different system dynamics and interaction modes. Based on the comparison results, a new method, called the sublevel safe set algorithm, is derived under the unified framework by optimizing the hyperparameters. The proposed algorithm achieves the best performance in terms of safety and efficiency on all benchmark problems.}

  abstract={Intersection management is one of the most representative applications of intelligent vehicles with connected and autonomous functions. The connectivity provides environmental information that a single vehicle cannot sense, and the autonomy supports precise vehicular control that a human driver cannot achieve. Intersection management solves the fundamental conflict resolution problem for vehicles—two vehicles should not appear at the same location at the same time, and, if they intend to do that, an order should be decided to optimize certain objectives such as the traffic throughput or smoothness. In this paper, we first propose a graph-based model for intersection management. The model is general and applicable to different granularities of intersections and other conflicting scenarios. We then derive formal verification approaches which can guarantee deadlock-freeness. Based on the graph-based model and the verification approaches, we develop a centralized cycle removal algorithm for the graph-based model to schedule vehicles to go through the intersection safely (without collisions) and efficiently without deadlocks. Experimental results demonstrate the expressiveness of the proposed model and the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.}

Accurate prediction of human motion can not only improve efficiency in human robot collaboration, but also enhance human safety in close proximity to robots. Among existing prediction models, the parameterization and identification methods of those models vary. It remains unclear what is the necessary parameterization of a prediction model, whether online adaptation of the model is necessary, and whether prediction can help improve safety and efficiency during human robot collaboration. These problems result from the difficulty to quantitatively evaluate various prediction models in a closed-loop fashion in real human-robot interaction settings. This paper develops a method to evaluate the closed-loop performance of different prediction models. In particular, we compare models with different parameterizations and models with or without online parameter adaptation. Extensive experiments were conducted on a human robot collaboration platform. The experimental results demonstrated that human motion prediction significantly enhanced the collaboration efficiency and human safety. Adaptable prediction models that were parameterized by neural networks achieved the best performance.}

Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have been proposed to mediate between collision avoidance and goal achievement for multiple robots. However, it has been noted that reactive controllers (such as CBFs) are prone to deadlock, an equilibrium that causes the robots to stall before reaching their goals. In this paper, we formally analyze two and three robot systems and discover circumstances under which CBFs cause deadlocks using duality theory. For the two robot system, we consider mutually heterogeneous robots (such as one more vigorous or closer to its goal than the other) and prove that this heterogeneity does not help in preventing deadlock. We then consider three robots, and conclude from these two scenarios that the geometric symmetry resulting from robots’ initial positions and goals constrains CBFs to generate velocities that render deadlock stable. Thus, conferring skewness to the system can help evade deadlock.},

  abstract={Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is becoming increasingly important as the paradigm of manufacturing is shifting from mass production to mass customization. The introduction of HRC can significantly improve the flexibility and intelligence of automation. To efficiently finish tasks in HRC systems, the robots need to not only predict the future movements of human, but also more high-level plans, i.e., the sequence of actions to finish the tasks. However, due to the stochastic and time-varying nature of human collaborators, it is quite challenging for the robot to efficiently and accurately identify such task plans and respond in a safe manner. To address this challenge, we propose an integrated human-robot collaboration framework. Both plan recognition and trajectory prediction modules are included for the generation of safe and efficient robotic motions. Such a framework enables the robots to perceive, predict and adapt their actions to the human's work plan and intelligently avoid collisions with the human. Moreover, by explicitly leveraging the hierarchical relationship between plans and trajectories, more robust plan recognition performance can be achieved. Physical experiments were conducted on an industrial robot to verify the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework could accurately recognize the human workers’ plans and thus significantly improve the time efficiency of the HRC team even in the presence of motion classification noises.}

Future robots are envisioned to be acting like human, which are independent entities that make decisions for themselves; intelligent actuators that interact with the physical world; and involved observers that have rich senses and critical judgements. Most importantly, they are entitled social attributions to build relationships with humans. We call these robots co-robots. Technically, it is challenging to design the behavior of co-robots.

We first formulate a microscopic multi-agent epidemic model where every agent can choose its activity level that affects the spread of the disease. Then by minimizing agents' cost functions, we solve for the optimal decisions for individual agents in the framework of game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Given the optimal decisions of all agents, we can make predictions about the spread of the disease. We show that there are negative externalities in the sense that infected agents do not have enough incentives to protect others, which then necessitates external interventions to regulate agents' behaviors. In the discussion section, future directions are pointed out to make the model more realistic.

With the help of vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication and autonomous driving technology, there are opportunities to alleviate congestion and delay resulting from lane merging. In this paper, we first summarize modern features and requirements for lane merging, along with the advance of vehicular technology. We then formulate and propose a dynamic programming algorithm to find the optimal solution for a two-lane merging scenario. It schedules the passing order for vehicles while minimizing the time needed for all vehicles to go through the merging point (equivalent to the time that the last vehicle goes through the merging point). We further extend the problem to a consecutive lane-merging scenario. We show the difficulty to apply the original dynamic programming to the consecutive lane-merging scenario and propose an improved version to solve it. Experimental results show that our dynamic programming algorithm can efficiently minimize the time needed for all vehicles to go through the merging point and reduce the average delay of all vehicles, compared with some greedy methods.}

Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have been proposed for synthesizing controllers guarantee collision avoidance and goal stabilization for multiple robots. However, it has been noted reactive control synthesis methods (such as CBFs) are prone to deadlock, an equilibrium of system dynamics causes robots to come to a standstill before reaching their goals. In this paper, we formally derive characteristics of deadlock in a multirobot system uses CBFs. We propose a novel approach to analyze deadlocks resulting from optimization based controllers (CBFs) by bor- rowing tools from duality theory and graph enumeration. Our key insight is system deadlock is characterized by a force-equilibrium on robots and we show how complexity of deadlock analysis increases approximately exponentially with the number of robots. This analysis allows us to interpret deadlock as a subset of the state space, and we prove this set is non-empty, bounded and located on the boundary of the safety set. Finally, we use these properties to develop a provably correct decentralized algorithm for deadlock resolution which ensures robots converge to their goals while avoiding collisions. We show simulation results of the resolution algorithm for two and three robots and experimentally validate this algorithm on Khepera-IV robots.}

These issues can be overcome if all vehicles can form a consensus by solving the same multi-vehicle trajectory planning problem. Then the major challenge is how to efficiently solve the multi-vehicle trajectory planning problem in real time under the curse of dimensionality. We introduce a novel planner for multi-vehicle trajectory planning based on the convex feasible set (CFS) algorithm. The planning problem is formulated as a non-convex optimization. A novel convexification method to obtain the maximal convex feasible set is proposed, which transforms the problem into a quadratic programming.

The nonlinear and nonconvex planning problem is computationally expensive to solve, which limits the application of robot arms in the real world. In this paper, for redundant robot arm planning problems with complex constraints, we present a motion planning method using iterative convex optimization that can efficiently handle the constraints and generate optimal trajectories in real time. The proposed planner guarantees the satisfaction of the contact-rich task constraints and avoids collision in confined environments. Extensive experiments on trajectory generation for weld grinding are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its applicability in advanced robotic manufacturing.}",

  abstract={Policy learning for delicate industrial insertion tasks (e.g., PC board assembly) is challenging. This paper considers two major problems: how to learn a diversified policy (instead of just one average policy) that can efficiently handle different workpieces with minimum amount of training data, and how to handle defects of workpieces during insertion. To address the problems, we propose tolerance-guided policy learning. To encourage transferability of the learned policy to different workpieces, we add a task embedding to the policy's input space using the insertion tolerance. Then we train the policy using generative adversarial imitation learning with reward shaping (RS-GAIL) on a variety of representative situations. To encourage adaptability of the learned policy to handle defects, we build a probabilistic inference model that can output the best inserting pose based on failed insertions using the tolerance model. The best inserting pose is then used as a reference to the learned policy. This proposed method is validated on a sequence of IC socket insertion tasks in simulation. The results show that 1) RS-GAIL can efficiently learn optimal policies under sparse rewards; 2) the tolerance embedding can enhance the transferability of the learned policy; 3) the probabilistic inference makes the policy robust to defects on the workpieces.}
