  abstract = 	 {High fidelity behavior prediction of intelligent agents is critical in many applications. However, the prediction model trained on the training set may not generalize to the testing set due to domain shift and time variance. The challenge motivates the adoption of online adaptation algorithms to update prediction models in real-time to improve the prediction performance. Inspired by Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), this paper introduces a series of online adaptation methods, which are applicable to neural network-based models. A base adaptation algorithm Modified EKF with forgetting factor (MEKF_lambda) is introduced first, followed by exponential moving average filtering techniques. Then this paper introduces a dynamic multi-epoch update strategy to effectively utilize samples received in real time. With all these extensions, we propose a robust online adaptation algorithm: MEKF with Exponential Moving Average and Dynamic Multi-Epoch strategy (MEKF_EMA-DME). The proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods as demonstrated in experiments.}

    abstract = "{Trajectory planning is an essential module for autonomous driving. To deal with multi-vehicle interactions, existing methods follow the prediction-then-plan approaches which first predict the trajectories of others then plan the trajectory for the ego vehicle given the predictions. However, since the true trajectories of others may deviate from the predictions, frequent re-planning for the ego vehicle is needed, which may cause many issues such as instability or deadlock. These issues can be overcome if all vehicles can form a consensus by solving the same multi-vehicle trajectory planning problem. Then the major challenge is how to efficiently solve the multi-vehicle trajectory planning problem in real time under the curse of dimensionality. We introduce a novel planner for multi-vehicle trajectory planning based on the convex feasible set (CFS) algorithm. The planning problem is formulated as a non-convex optimization. A novel convexification method to obtain the maximal convex feasible set is proposed, which transforms the problem into a quadratic programming. Simulations in multiple typical on-road driving situations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed planning algorithm in terms of completeness and optimality.}",

The motion planning problem for robot trajectory generation is highly nonlinear and nonconvex, which usually comes with collision avoidance constraints, robot kinematics and dynamics constraints, and task constraints (e.g., following a Cartesian trajectory defined on a surface and maintain the contact). The nonlinear and nonconvex planning problem is computationally expensive to solve, which limits the application of robot arms in the real world. In this paper, for redundant robot arm planning problems with complex constraints, we present a motion planning method using iterative convex optimization that can efficiently handle the constraints and generate optimal trajectories in real time. The proposed planner guarantees the satisfaction of the contact-rich task constraints and avoids collision in confined environments. Extensive experiments on trajectory generation for weld grinding are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its applicability in advanced robotic manufacturing.}",

  abstract = {Collision avoidance for multirobot systems has been studied thoroughly. Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have been proposed to mediate between collision avoidance and goal achievement for multiple robots. However, it has been noted that reactive controllers (such as CBFs) are prone to deadlock, an equilibrium that causes the robots to stall before reaching their goals. In this paper, we formally analyze two and three robot systems and discover circumstances under which CBFs cause deadlocks using duality theory. For the two robot system, we consider mutually heterogeneous robots (such as one more vigorous or closer to its goal than the other) and prove that this heterogeneity does not help in preventing deadlock. We then consider three robots, and conclude from these two scenarios that the geometric symmetry resulting from robots’ initial positions and goals constrains CBFs to generate velocities that render deadlock stable. Thus, conferring skewness to the system can help evade deadlock.}
